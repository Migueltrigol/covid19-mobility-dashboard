### Covid-19 Mobility Response in Spain

A few months ago, the Spanish minister of transport published anonymous and aggregated journey data on trips taken during the Covid-19 pandemic. These datasets were derived from signal records on the mobile phone network.

This repository aims to create an interactive dashboard to present and analyze some of the aforementioned data in a dynamic and engaging manner.

The dashboard provides the user with the percentage of the population, categorized by municipality, that engaged in different numbers of trips. Users can select specific municipalities and explore their daily trends.
